# Makefile Templates

## Language

## Introduction

Here are some **Makefile Templates** for different size of projects, from simple project with a 'flat' source file structure, to bigger project with a 'complex' structure.

These templates may not be clear or concise enough, because they are built for specific use cases. 
Some of them may have severe *side-affect* on scalability, although at the time you probably will consider a different aproche anyway.
